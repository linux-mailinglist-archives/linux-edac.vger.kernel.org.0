This is an RFC because the kernel side is currently under review and
may change with obvious follow through effects on this.

There are a few additional questions around this:
1. Divide between specifity of DB fields vs blobs.
   Where possible I have tried to fully describe the contents via
   separate fields rather than large blobs.  One common SQL convention
   that doesn't seem to have been previously done in rasdaemon is to
   use explicit NULL entries for elements where data is missing.
2. Should we split ras-record.c and have the ccix handling in a separate
   ras-record-ccix.c file or similar as that one is getting rather large.

Note the following is a trademark grant and doesn't prevent normal
stuff covered under fair use.  Given this doesn't current quote from
the spec, there are no such copyright notices.
