Emmm, when I received your replied email, I thought you had fully reviewed them. So
I work to address your comments and reply as soon as possible. Sorry, I misunderstood.

Of course, I can wait. As I said before, take your time.

By the way, I have a question about review process: after waiting for a period
of time, how can I tell whether you have no comments or are still in review process?

Best Regards,
Shuai
