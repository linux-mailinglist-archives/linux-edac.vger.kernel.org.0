Yes, it should be this way: if there are no consumers, all error
information should go to dmesg so that it gets printed at least.

Probably but I don't think there's an example of an actual system where
there are no other MCE consumers registered. Not if its users care about
RAS. This default fallback was added for the hypothetical case anyway.

Before we go and fix whatever, we need to define what exactly we're
fixing. Is there an actual system you're seeing this on or is this
something that would never happen in reality? Because if the latter, I
don't really care TBH. As in, there's more important stuff to take care
of first.
