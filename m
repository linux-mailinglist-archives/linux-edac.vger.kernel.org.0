Lots of stuff goes to linux-doc, I can miss things.

Of course, I miss things in my own email too...you know the drill...

The hope with all of this documentation thrashing has been to organize
our docs with the *reader* in mind.  "All things RAS" is convenient for
RAS developers, but not for (say) a sysadmin trying to figure out how to
make use of it.  So I would really rather see RAS documentation placed
under admin-guide or userspace-api as appropriate.

Yes, there is a lot of existing documentation that still doesn't live up
to this idea, but we can try to follow it for new stuff while the rest
is (slowly) fixed up.

Make sense?

Thanks,

jon
