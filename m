No, it doesn't. You always have the option of a direct call to an 
indirect JMP. This is in fact exactly what userspace does in the form of 
the PLT.

Well, obviously there has to be a magic inline at the patch site. It 
ends up looking something like this:

	asm volatile("1:"
		     ALTERNATIVE_2("call pv_wrmsr(%%rip)",
			"nop; wrmsr", X86_FEATURE_NATIVE_MSR,
			"nop; wrmsrns", X86_FEATURE_WRMSRNS)
		     "2:"
		     _ASM_EXTABLE_TYPE(1b+1, 2b, EX_TYPE_WRMSR)
		     : : "c" (msr), "a" (low), "d" (high) : "memory");


[one can argue whether or not WRMSRNS specifically should require 
"memory" or not.]

The whole bit with alternatives and pvops being separate is a major 
maintainability problem, and honestly it never made any sense in the 
first place. Never have two mechanisms to do one job; it makes it harder 
to grok their interactions.

As an alternative to the NOP, the EX_TYPE_*MSR* handlers could simply 
look for a CALL opcode at the origin.
