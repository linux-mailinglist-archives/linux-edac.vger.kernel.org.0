Nope.  In the description the docs say "in addition to the author
attribute in the From: tag"  There are also examples where there
isn't a Co-dev for the From author including the subtle question of
ordering if someone else posts that patch.

I have a vague recollection one of the scripts checking linux-next
might moan about this.

Docs are clear that sender of the patch must be last SoB.
That's also checked by the some of the tag block check scripts
I think.  There's an example of exactly this case in the in the
submitting-patches.rst file (last one in the section that talks
about Co-developed-by.

For meaning I don't care that much, but keeping to the rigid
rules in that doc makes it easier for scripts to check for the
more important stuff like whether all necessary SoB are there.
