The "consume" is at the application point of view, e.g. a memory read. If
poison is enable, then a SRAR error will be detected and a MCE raised
at the point of the consumption in the execution flow.

A generic Intel x86 hw behaves like below:

1. UE Error Inject at a known Physical Address. (by einj_mem_uc through EINJ interface)
2. Core Issue a Memory Read to the same Physical Address (by a singe memory read)
3. iMC Detects the error.
4. HA logs UCA error and signals CMCI if enabled
5. HA Forward data with poison indication bit set.
6. CBo detects the Poison data. Does not log any error.
7. MLC detects the Poison data.
8. DCU detects the Poison data, logs SRAR error and trigger MCERR if recoverable
9. OS/VMM takes corresponding recovery action based on affected state.

In our example:
-  step 2 is triggered by a singe memory read.
-  step 8: UCR errors detected on data load, MCACOD 134H, triggering MCERR
-  step 9: the kernel is excepted to send sigbus with si_code BUS_MCEERR_AR (code 4)

I also run the same test  in AMD EPYC platform, e.g. Milan, Genoa, which
behaves the same as Intel Xeon platform, e.g. Icelake, SPR.

The ARMv8.2 RAS extension support similar data poison mechanism, a
Synchronous External Abort on arm64 (analogy Machine Check Exception on
x86) will be trigger in setp 8. See James comments for details.  But the
kernel sends sigbus with si_code BUS_MCEERR_AO (code 5) , tested on
Alibaba Yitian710 and Huawei Kunepng 920.

Yes, exactly. Thank you for point it out. We are talking about synchronous errors.

Thank you for explaining.
