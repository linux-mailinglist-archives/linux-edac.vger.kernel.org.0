Hi Borislav

Thank you very much for all the useful notes. I've updated the series
in accordance with your comments. It will be submitted for review when the
merge window is open. Answers to some of your questions are below.

At least the authors are Cc'ed actually.

Seeing you've got so many questions I guess the text has turned to be
a bit hard to comprehend. I'll update the patch log to having less
history insides but being more oriented towards the actual problem.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Got it. The entire series of the patchsets will be fixed in accordance
with your request.

I'll move this change into another patch. The described problem can be
fixed with no need in this modification. Thus the patch will get to be
simpler for review.

IMO it's better to have some links than not to have them at all and say
something like "Synopsys databook claims it differently". At least
they will be useful for the developers who have those documents.

Yes it was the original intention - to get it backported, but it's up
to the stable tree maintainers to decide. The problem is real but very
much rare to be actually spotted especially seeing nobody has reported
about it yet.

I'll rename it to reglock. The structure already has it documented in

This comment will be added with a statement that the operation below
is "noop" for the older devices. Moreover the comment will be helpful
for the future driver hackers who would wish to add the DW uMCTL2
IP-core versions detected and utilized it in the driver. In none of
the my changes it was needed, so I didn't provide such functionality.

I have much doubt we'll hear out anything from the original
driver authors. Hopefully Michal and Alexander (in Cc-list) will help
us out with reviews and testing.
