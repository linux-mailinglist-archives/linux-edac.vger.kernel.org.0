So one of the observations from efforts like RAS API [1] is that CXL is
definining mechanisms that others are using for non-CXL use cases. I.e.
a CXL-like mailbox that supports events is a generic transport that can
be used for many RAS scenarios not just CXL endpoints. It supplants
building new ACPI interfaces for these things because the expectation is
that an OS just repurposes its CXL Type-3 infrastructure to also drive
event collection for RAS API compliant devices in the topology.

So when considering whether Linux should build support for ACPI RASF,
ACPI RAS2, and / or Open Compute RAS API it is worthwile to ask if one
of those can supplant the others.

Speaking only for myself with my Linux kernel maintainer hat on, I am
much more attracted to proposals like RAS API where native drivers can
be deployed vs ACPI which brings ACPI static definition baggage and a
3rd component to manage. RAS API is kernel driver + device-firmware
while I assume ACPI RAS* is kernel ACPI driver + BIOS firmware +
device-firmware.

In other words, this patch proposal enables both CXL memscrub and ACPI
RAS2 memscrub. It asserts that nobody cares about ACPI RASF memscrub,
and your clarification asserts that RAS2 is basically dead until Linux
adopts it. So then the question becomes why should Linux breath air into
the ACPI RAS2 memscrub proposal when initiatives like RAS API exist?

The RAS API example seems to indicate that one way to get scrub support
for non-CXL memory controllers would be to reuse CXL memscrub
infrastructure. In a world where there is kernel mechanism to understand
CXL-like scrub mechanisms, why not nudge the industry in that direction
instead of continuing to build new and different ACPI mechanisms?

That does help, it would help even more if the maintenance burden of CXL
scrub precludes needing to carry the burden of other implementations.

This answers my main question of whether RAS2 is a done deal with
shipping platforms making it awkward for Linux to *not* support RAS2, or
if this is the start of an industry conversation that wants some Linux
ecosystem feedback. It sounds more like the latter.

Thanks again for taking the time Jonathan.
