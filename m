Depends on the kernel patches being accepted:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-edac/20190820144732.2370-1-Jonathan.Cameron@huawei.com/T/#t

Changes since v1:
* Separated out the ras-record section into its own file.
* Rebased on current rasdaemon tree.

This series introduced rasdaemon support to match against the above
series which provides the tracepoints for CCIX PER error reporting from
the kernel to userspace.

These are errors which occur at the CCIX protocol layer which sits
on top of PCIe (for which we have AER).  They are defined in the
CCIX base specification v1.0 an evaluation version of which is available
at www.ccixconsortium.org.

Note the following is a trademark grant and doesn't prevent normal
stuff covered under fair use.  Given this set doesn't quote from
the spec (other than field names), there are no such copyright
notices.

This patch is being distributed by the CCIX Consortium, Inc. (CCIX) to
you and other parties that are participating (the "participants") in
rasdemon project with the understanding that the participants will use CCIX's
name and trademark only when this patch is used in association with
rasdaemon.

CCIX is also distributing this patch to these participants with the
understanding that if any portion of the CCIX specification will be
used or referenced in rasdaemon, the participants will not modify
the cited portion of the CCIX specification and will give CCIX proper
copyright attribution by including the following copyright notice with
