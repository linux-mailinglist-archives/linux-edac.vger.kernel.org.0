RAS API is certainly interesting but the bit of the discussion
that matters here will equally apply to CXL RAS controls as of today
(will ship before OCP) and Open Compute's RAS API (sometime in the future).

The subsystem presented here was to address the "show us your code" that
was inevitable feedback if we'd gone for a discussion Doc style RFC.

What really matters here is whether a common ABI is necessary and what
it looks like.
Not even the infrastructure, just whether it's sysfs and what the controls)
Sure there is less code if it all looks like that CXL get feature,
but not that much less.  + I'm hoping we'll also end up sharing with
the various embedded device solutions out there today.

I notice a few familiar names in the meeting recordings. Anyone want
to provide a summary of overlap etc and likely end result?
I scan read the docs and caught up with some meetings at high speed,
but that's not the same as day to day involvement in the spec development. 
Maybe the lesson to take away from this is a more general interface is
needed incorporating scrub control (which at this stage is probably
just a name change!)

I see that patrol scrub is on the RAS actions list which is great.

Not really. The only thing needed from BIOS firmware is a static table
 to OS to describe where to find the hardware (RAS2 is a header and (1+)
pointers to the PCCT table entry that tells you where the mailbox(s)
(PCC Channel) are and their interrupts etc.  It's all of 48 bytes of
static data to parse.

Could have been done that in DSDT (where you will find other PCC channels
as many methods can use them under the hood to chat to firmware + there
are some other users where they are the only option) but my guess is
assumption is RAS might be needed pre AML interpreter so it's a static table.

A PCC channel is the ACPI spec standard mailbox design (well several
options for how to do it, but given the code is upstream and in use
for other purposes, no new maintenance burden for us :)
PCC channels can be shared resources handling multiple protocols.
They are used for various other things where the OS needs
to talk to firmware and have been upstream for a while.


ACPI driver --------<PCC Mailbox>---> Device Firmware
vs
RAS API Driver-----<CXL Mailbox>----> Device Firmware
or
CXL Driver --------<CXL Mailbox>----> Device Firmware

The new complexity (much like the CXL solution) lies in the
control protocol sent over the mailbox (which is pretty simple!)

Some of the complexity in the driver is left over from earlier
version doing RASF and RAS2 so we'll flatten that layering out
and it'll be even simpler in next RFC and perhaps not hint at
false complexity or maintenance burden.

The only significant burden I really see form incorporating RAS2
is the need for an interface that works for both (very similar)
configuration control sets.  Once that is defined we need to support
the ABI for ever anyway so may be sysfs attribute of extra ABI to
support in current design?

A fair question and one where I'm looking for inputs from others.

However I think you may be assuming a lot more than is actually
involved in the RAS2 approach - see below.

There may be some shared elements of course (and it seems the RAS API
stuff has severak sets of proposals for interfacing approaches), but ultimately
a RAS API element still hangs off something that isn't a CXL device, so
still demands some common infrastructure (e.g. a class or similar) or
we are going to find the RAS tools buried under a bunch of different individual
drivers.
1) Maybe shared for system components (maybe not from some of the diagrams!)
   But likely 1 interface per socket. Probably PCI, but maybe platform devices
   (I'd not be surprised to see a PCC channel type added for this mailbox)
   /sys/bus/pci/devices/pcixxx/rasstuff/etc
2) CXL devices say /sys/bus/cxl/devices/mem0/rasstuff/etc.
3) Other system components such as random PCI drivers.

Like other cases of common infrastructure, I'd argue for a nice class with
the devices parentage linking back to the underlying EP driver.
/sys/class/ras/ras0 parent ->   /sys/bus/cxl/devices/mem0/
/sys/class/ras/ras1 parent ->   /sys/bus/pci/device/pcixxx/ RAS API device.
etc

Same as if we had a bunch of devices that happened to have an LED on them
and wanted common userspace controls so registered with /sys/class/led

So to me RAS API looks like another user of this proposal that indeed
shares a bunch of common code with the CXL driver stack (hopefully they'll
move to PCI MMPT from current definition based on CXL 2.0 mailbox so the
discoverability isn't CXL spec based. (I may not have latest version of course!)

I think we disagree on whether the burden is significant - sure
we can spin interfaces differently to make it easier for CXL and we can
just stick it on the individual endpoints for now.

Key here is ABI, I don't really care about whether we wrap it up in a subsystem
(mostly we do that to enforce compliance with the ABI design as easier than
 reviewing against a document!)

I want to see userspace ABI that is general enough to extend to other
devices and doesn't require a horrible hydra of a userspace program on top
of incompatible controls because everyone wanted to do it slightly
differently.  The exercise of including RAS2 (and earlier RASF which
we dropped) was about establishing commonality and I think that was very
useful.

I'm reluctant to say it will never be necessary to support RAS2 (because
I want to see solutions well before anyone will have built OCPs proposal
and RAS2 works on many of today's systems with a small amount of firmware
work, many have existing PCC channels to appropriate management controllers
and as I understand it non standard interfaces to control the scrubbing
engines).

So I think not considering an ABI that is designed to be general is just
storing up pain for us in the future.

I'm not sure the design we have here is the right one which is why it
was an RFC :)

I'll let others speak up on this as I was presenting on my current outlook
and understand others are much further down the path.
