Whatever - I'm not even going to ask why the distinction is being made.

Sure, but that belongs in the changelog - not in a static comment. "new
systems" turns into old systems after a couple of years. :)

I guess. They haven't pissed me off that much yet and since you're going
to be staring at that thing...

Yes.

Then you can express that dependency in those other modules' Kconfig
stanzas. No need to check vendor here.

So if this fails loading, then you need to return an error from the
loading routine and the other modules should not load.

If the other modules should still load, then you need to make the
translation lib optional and use the module device table thing so that
the translation lib can exist independently.

However, then you need to handle the case where the other module calls
into the translation lib and at exactly the same time, that library
module is removed. There must be a way to prevent this in the module
code, ref counting perhaps, but you'll have to check how exactly.

Ah, then it should be in asm/atl.h

So Zen4 server. Still better to have the generation and hw type than
some italian name which we will forget.

Documentation/ras/ I guess?

Oh fun.

Thx.
