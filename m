Indeed.  At what point is the lack of information and response long
enough to simply commit a revert due to those lacks?

Even with the commit message having been rewritten and the link to:
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20210628172740.245689-1-Smita.KoralahalliChannabasappa@amd.com
added, this still reads as roughly:

"A hypothetical bug on a hypothetivisor"

I rather suspect a genuine issue was observed, but with absolutely no
detail this is useless.  I can make some guesses, but those guesses
relation to reality is dubious.

Which seems oddly similar to:
"the Linux kernel may be handling adminstrative duties/hardware
for a hypervisor.  In this case, the events need to be processed and
potentially passed back through the hypervisor."

This could be emulated.  With it not being officially specified the
emulation may not be too accurate, but it is possible.  Admittedly VMware
may have abandoned this level of perfect emulation accuracy, but one
could do it.  Which would be "full virtualization of MCE events."

Indeed.  Those will also need similar treatment, but that wouldn't be a
revert of 767f4b620eda.  I found 767f4b620eda in the process of looking
for the correct hook point.



There are at least two, and possibly more, points of view with regards
to MCE and virtualization.  I keep noticing most implementers are
strictly thinking of perfect, full virtualization of hardware, and
missing what is actually desired.

Full virtualization is where you are renting an actual physical slice of
actual hardware, proper virtualization of CEs and UEs is desireable.

In reality most clients merely want to rent the processing power the
hardware provides and not deal with actually owning the hardware.  To
them, CEs are an annoyance since they clutter logs and they're not
something they're in a position to deal with.  Instead the owner of the
hardware wants the CEs so they can monitor hardware health.

What you want depends on your SLAs, but the most prominent authors keep
missing that many clients (VM owners) don't actually want to deal with
CEs.  A SLA could also state a single UE means discarding current VM
state and rolling back to the last known good checkpoint.
