I would say that the main consumer for this are post-mortem tools that
collect information of the vmcore and do diagnostic and correlation.
This is a common tooling for cloud providers, AFAIK.

In my work environment, there is a script that runs `drgn` on every
vmcore to capture information that would help operator to address the
problem. The information that this patch is proposing adds another field
that would help to potentially correlate crashes with recoverable error.

Would a solution like this look better?

	enum hwerr_error_type {
		HWERR_RECOV_CPU,
		HWERR_RECOV_MEMORY,
		HWERR_RECOV_PCI,
		HWERR_RECOV_CXL,
		HWERR_RECOV_OTHERS,
	#ifdef CONFIG_X86_MCE
		HWERR_RECOV_MCE,
	#endif
		HWERR_RECOV_MAX,
	};

Or, would you prefer to have HWERR_RECOV_ARCH and keep it always there?

Sorry. I tried to improve the documentation and wrote the following
message to the commit message, which was clearly not enough.

	This helps fleet operators quickly triage whether a crash may be
	influenced by hardware recoverable errors (which executes a uncommon
	code path in the kernel), especially when recoverable errors occurred
	shortly before a panic, such as the bug fixed by
	commit ee62ce7a1d90 ("page_pool: Track DMA-mapped pages and unmap them
	when destroying the pool")

For next commit I will add a cover-letter, with the summary of the
details of that discussion.

Thanks for the review and suggestions,
--breno
