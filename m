With regards to (2), the IMO only sensible solution is to have the ABI be =
the one of the native instruction, and to have the PVXXL users take the ful=
l brunt of the overhead=2E That means that on a native or HVM machine, the =
proper code gets patched in inline, and the PVXXL code becomes a call to a =
stub to do the parameter marshalling before walking off back into C ABI lan=
d=2E The pvop further has to bear the full cost of providing the full nativ=
e semantics unless otherwise agreed with the native maintainers and explici=
tly documented what the modified semantics are (notably, having excplicit s=
tubs for certain specific MSRs is entirely reasonable=2E)

In case this sounds familiar, it is the pvops we were promised over 15 yea=
rs ago, and yet somehow never really got there=2E It *also* is similar in a=
n inside-out way of the ABI marshalling used for legacy BIOS functions in t=
he 16-bit startup code=2E

In-place "fat" paravirtualization in the Linux kernel has been a horror sh=
ow, with the notable exception of UML, which is almost universally ignored =
but yet manages to stay out of the way and keep working=2E

This is a classic case of Tragedy of The Commons, much like burning coal f=
or power=2E
