Hi

I upgraded the kernel to 6.4.4 and it still has this bug (see 
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/YqD1YjeovGu28xsP@yaz-fattaah/T/ for the 
beginning of this thread).

The patch below fixes these warnings.

I'd like to ask you to submit the patch upstream, with

Fixes: 7f99cb5e6039 ("x86/CPU/AMD: Use default_groups in kobj_type")
Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org	# v5.18+
Tested-by: Mikulas Patocka <mpatocka@redhat.com>
