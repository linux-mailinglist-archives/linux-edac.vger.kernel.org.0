What I meant was "there should be the two top-level APIs, and under the
covers they DTRT".  Part of doing the right thing is to wire up paravirt
for configs where that is specified.

Anything else is going to force people to write logic of the form:

    if (WRMSRNS && !XENPV)
        wrmsr_ns(...)
    else
        wrmsr(...)

which is going to be worse overall.  And there really is one example of
this antipattern already in the series.

Yeah, this is daft.  But it can also be fixed irrespective of WRMSRNS.

WRMSR has one complexity that most other PV-ops don't, and that's the
exception table reference for the instruction itself.

In a theoretical future ought to look like:

    mov    $msr, %ecx
    mov    $lo, %eax
    mov    $hi, %edx
    1: {call paravirt_blah(%rip) | cs...cs wrmsr | cs...cs wrmsrns }
    _ASM_EXTABLE(1b, ...)

In paravirt builds, the CALL needs to be the emitted form, because it
needs to function in very early boot.

But once the paravirt-ness has been chosen and alternatives run, the
as-native paths are fully inline.

The alternative which processes this site wants to conclude that, in the
case it does not alter from the CALL, to clobber the EXTABLE reference. 
CALL instructions can #GP, and you don't want to end up thinking you're
handling a WRMSR #GP when in fact it was a non-canonical function pointer.

STI/CLI are already magic.  Are they not inlined?

Well - point 1 is mostly work that needs reverting as part of completing
point 3, and point 2 clearly needs doing irrespective of anything else.
