If they really are independent then I guess. Not that it all ends up in
a twisty dependency where you wish you should've merged the two
together. So think about all deps before you design this - it needs to
handle all cases without hackery.

What does that have to do with this? SMN access is generic and should be
in amd_nb.c as it is needed by other stuff. EDAC, RAS, whatever are all
users of that thing.

Is that a real use case or just a hypothetical thing?

This sounds weird.

It is there because it doesn't need EDAC at all. If your translation
doesn't need EDAC and EDAC is going to be only a user of it, then good.

But if you're going to have to need the MCA error decoded by EDAC and
then the error translation done by this thing, then you'd need to
synchronize between the two. I'm not saying it is impossible - it should
be well thought out first though before you go coding.

AER is part of PCI so we haven't considereed tying it into EDAC. And
there wasn't any desire to do so.

As to APEI, there's ghes_edac...
