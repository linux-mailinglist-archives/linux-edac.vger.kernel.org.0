Problem is you were objecting to 'probable hypothetical "may"
formulations' in what I wrote, yet the original patch message overtly
uses that word.

In order for the first patch to be correct, it is insufficient for the
condition to be unlikely.  Ideally it should be mathematically proven
impossible.

As such I was writing about known counter-examples from the real world.
Mainly at least one hypervisor (Xen) does tend to allow a particular VM
to access sensitive system registers.  Also it is entirely possible some
hypervisor could proxy access to the registers and thus properly simulate
the events.

Not only that, but in fact this very strategy was already actively
deployed:
https://bugs.debian.org/810964

I'm less than 100% certain this successfully retrieves EDAC events on Xen
right now, so I had been taking a look at the situation only to find
767f4b620eda.

Perhaps everyone should consult with large-scale system administrators
when doing things which effect them?
