Hi Jonathan,

(Beware: this CCIX thing is new to me, some of this will be questions on the scope of CCIX)

I can't find a public version of this spec, and I don't have an account to look at the
private one. (It looks like I could get one but I'm guessing there is an NDA between me
and the document text!)

Will it ever be public?

How does this interact with the vanilla Memory-Error CPER records? Do we always get them
as a pair? (that struct definition looks familiar...)

Is memory described like this never present in the UEFI memory map? (so we never
accidentally use it as host memory, for processes etc)

include/linux/memremap.h has:

Is this the same CCIX?

If process memory can be migrated onto this stuff we need to kick off memory_failure() in
response to memory errors, otherwise we don't mark the pages as poison, signal user-space etc.

It looks like this stuff operates 'over' PCIe[0]. How does this interact with AER?
Will we always get a vanilla PCIE-AER CPER in addition to these two?

(I see 'CHECK THE AER EQUIVALENT' comments in your series, are these TODO:?)

I think its okay to spit these blobs out of the trace points, but could we avoid printing
them in the kernel log?

(I suspect I don't understand this).

The filtering can be done by user-space. Isn't that enough?

I see the memory-error event format file has 'pa', which is all anyone is likely to care
about.
Do 'source/component' indicate the device? (what do I pull out of the machine to stop
these happening?)

Is this text permission from the CCIX-Consortium to reproduce bits of their spec in the
kernel?

I'm guessing any one who can hold of the spec is also prevented from publishing it.

(Nits: participating, proper)


Thanks,

James
