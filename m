You seem to be looking for a solution that is entirely contained within
the machine check handling code. Willing to allow for repeated machine
checks from the same poison address in order to achieve that.

I'm opposed to mutliple machine checks.  Willing to make some changes
in core code to avoid repeated access to the same poison location.

We need a tie-breaker.
