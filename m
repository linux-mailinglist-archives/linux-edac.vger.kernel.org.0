Another alternative would be an ACPI device where you can use the same
_HID (or at least a _CID) for all the chipsets.

Right, it is typically based on the platform; that's why I said "in
reverse."  I think all these devices are integrated into the chipset,
so I'm speculating that platform vendors would have no need (maybe
even no way) to use the Subsystem ID.  But maybe that's not the case.

I think there are some drivers that do this, and it's not completely
terrible.  The probe() can just return failure if it doesn't want the
device.
