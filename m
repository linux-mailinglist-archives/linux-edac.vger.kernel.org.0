Not too late, thanks for your thoughts!  When I apply things, I
consider them a draft with intention to go upstream, but not
immutable.  If it makes sense to revise or postpone, we can still do
that.

All the tracepoints here already include:

  - pci_name() (the bus/device/function)

  - slot_name() (which I think comes from make_slot_name(); would you
    want something else?)

and IIUC, it would be helpful for you to add:

  - DSP Vendor/Device ID (the Root Port or Switch Downstream Port,
    which is relatively static, so seems less useful to me than the
    USP/EP would be)

  - USP/EP Vendor/Device ID

And you would consider adding a new format for "Link Up" that would
include the above plus current link speed/width?  I expect we will
likely see new tracepoints similar to "Link Up" for link speed/width
changes done by bwctrl, and this would definitely make sense for
those.

As a consumer of tracepoints, do you have an opinion on the event
string?  I wonder if spaces in the strings complicate searching and
scripting?  I don't think tracepoints necessarily need to match text
in dmesg exactly because I suspect they're mostly processed
mechanically.  But I'm not a tracepoint user myself (yet), and about
20% of existing tracepoints already include spaces, so maybe it's not
a concern.
