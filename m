I wish this proposal will not embarrass you as I had know previous
correspondence with you.

I am Mr. Ali Sabyani, a Syrian national. My objective is to establish
a liable business relationship with you. I am Personal Assistant to
Late General Daoud Rajha (Former Syria Defence Minister) who was
killed in a mounted bomb explosion on Wednesday, 18th July, 2012
inside the Syrian National Security headquarters in Damascus which
targeted Ministers of President Bashar Assad's regime who were meeting
with Defense Officials.

Whilst I am in a hideout since Wednesday, 18th July, 2012 trying to
find my way out of Syria territory, from there I got a Muslim Africa
brother who helped me. In the process of the ongoing war I lost my
father and mother. In other to proof to you about the genuineity of my
business, Please contact me on this email address:- alissy1964@gmail.com

Thanks.
