Hi, Jarkko,

It did not. It keeps track of whether memory_failure() work was queued,
and makes task_work pending to flush out the queue. But if no work queued for
synchronous error due to abnormal branches, it does not do a force kill to
current process resulting a hard lockup due to exception loop.

It is fine to me to remove the bug fix tag if you insist on removing it.

Best Regards,
Shuai
