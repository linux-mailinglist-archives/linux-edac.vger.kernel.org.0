Yup, and that is fragile. It can only work if the toolchain for firmware, the kernel and
hardware have only one configuration between them. I don't think we have enough control of
the platform to assert this.

(endian-ness is something the kernel configures during boot. I can happily kexec a
big-endian kernel on my Juno, even though the bootloader chokes and splutters when its
asked to do this.)

This stuff is 'implementation defined' for the compiler, we can't complain to the compiler
people if it doesn't do what we wanted.

Ha! The 'made-up:' was to indicate I really know nothing about this. I should have gone
for Bluefield++

Cool!
(With a different compiler that does the bitfields differently? *cough* *cough*)

Yes, edk2-platforms has a "Platform/ARM/JunoPkg/SmbiosPlatformDxe/SmbiosPlatformDxe.c"
which I assume is relevant to this.

Do you ship the same firmware image for both variants? I bet this isn't the only
difference. The SMC is overhead on the soldered-DRAM boards as its returning a constant
you could have baked into UEFI.

This is the sort of thing that platform firmware can just know.

If it really is variable yes, but in your soldered-DRAM chips case, surely its all numbers
you could bake into the tables.

If you add the DIMMs to the SMBIOS tables then this information is useful to other tools
in user-space too. The whole edac-facade is only useful if someone can put their paw in
the enclosure to replace the faulty dimm. Ultimately we need to correlate the errors with
something replaceable, and what we really want to know is what is the label on the
silk-screen next to the faulty dimm. This is what the SMBIOS tables are for.

Once the information is in the smbios tables, we don't want to duplicate it.
Only firmware can generate the smbios tables.


> So why go through this extra complicity when Linux can directly do the SMC?

From my view? Because these 'firmware tables' are where we expect to find all the
information from firmware. If the number of DIMMs changed while the system was running,
then an SMC would be the only choice. Having a mix of firmware-tables and runtime calls is
a bit odd.


> Or are you
> concerned about making this a standard so Windows can also figure out the DIMM configuration?

No, I'm just curious that you have some information in static firmware tables, and other
static information via a firmware runtime call.

Number of memory-controllers? This was just to check this hard-coded number really is
fixed. Its almost always better to shove things in the firmware table, even if you don't
think they're going to change. This way you don't need to change the driver when the
hardware people 'make it better'.

As it sounds like BlueField2 is going to be a thing, and it doesn't have the same memory
controller, this isn't a problem.

Its just a case of avoiding dependencies across exception boundaries, and with other projects.

Did I mention I may have it totally wrong? I've found some more on this to read...

This was tripped by your comment:

Was this determined experimentally, or is it expected/documented behaviour? If it seems
like that write doesn't always complete we should get to the bottom of this.
