## Cover Letter

There are two major types of uncorrected recoverable (UCR) errors :

- Synchronous error: The error is detected and raised at the point of the
  consumption in the execution flow, e.g. when a CPU tries to access
  a poisoned cache line. The CPU will take a synchronous error exception
  such as Synchronous External Abort (SEA) on Arm64 and Machine Check
  Exception (MCE) on X86. OS requires to take action (for example, offline
  failure page/kill failure thread) to recover this uncorrectable error.

- Asynchronous error: The error is detected out of processor execution
  context, e.g. when an error is detected by a background scrubber. Some data
  in the memory are corrupted. But the data have not been consumed. OS is
  optional to take action to recover this uncorrectable error.

Currently, both synchronous and asynchronous errors are queued by
ghes_handle_memory_failure() with flag 0, and handled by a dedicated kernel
thread in a work queue on the ARM64 platform. As a result, the memory
failure recovery sends SIBUS with wrong BUS_MCEERR_AO si_code for
synchronous errors in early kill mode. The main problem is that the
memory_failure() work is handled in kthread context but not the user-space
process context which is accessing the corrupt memory location, so it will
send SIGBUS with BUS_MCEERR_AO si_code to the user-space process instead of
BUS_MCEERR_AR in kill_proc().

Fix the problem by:
- Patch 1: seting memory_failure() flags as MF_ACTION_REQUIRED on synchronous
	   errors.
- Patch 2: performing a force kill if no memory_failure() work is queued for
	   synchronous errors.
- Patch 3: a minor comments improve.
- Patch 4: queueing memory_failure() as a task_work so that the current
	   context in memory_failure() exactly belongs to the process
	   consuming poison data.

Lv Ying and XiuQi from Huawei also proposed to address similar problem[2][4].
Acknowledge to discussion with them.

## Steps to Reproduce This Problem

To reproduce this problem:

	# STEP1: enable early kill mode
	#sysctl -w vm.memory_failure_early_kill=1
	vm.memory_failure_early_kill = 1

	# STEP2: inject an UCE error and consume it to trigger a synchronous error
	#einj_mem_uc single
	0: single   vaddr = 0xffffb0d75400 paddr = 4092d55b400
	injecting ...
	triggering ...
	signal 7 code 5 addr 0xffffb0d75000
	page not present
	Test passed

The si_code (code 5) from einj_mem_uc indicates that it is BUS_MCEERR_AO error
and it is not fact.

After this patch set:

	# STEP1: enable early kill mode
	#sysctl -w vm.memory_failure_early_kill=1
	vm.memory_failure_early_kill = 1

	# STEP2: inject an UCE error and consume it to trigger a synchronous error
	#einj_mem_uc single
	0: single   vaddr = 0xffffb0d75400 paddr = 4092d55b400
	injecting ...
	triggering ...
	signal 7 code 4 addr 0xffffb0d75000
	page not present
	Test passed

The si_code (code 4) from einj_mem_uc indicates that it is BUS_MCEERR_AR error
as we expected.
