My Dear friend.

With all due respect, I know this message will come to you as a
surprise, My name is Mr. Mohammad Ahmed a banker working with Bank of
Africa Du Burkina Faso West Africa, i need your urgent assistance to
transfer an abandoned Sum of 13.5 Millions USD into your account.

I am contacting you independently of my investigation in my bank and
no one is informed of this communication. I need your urgent
assistance to transfer the sum of $13.5Million Dollars to Your private
account; The Fund in question belongs to one of our late foreign
customer who died a long time ago with his family together with his
supposed NEXT OF KIN since the year 2005 in the plane crash.

The Fund has been here in our Bank coffers lying dormant for years now
without anybody coming to claim the fund as the late deceased family
relation for none of his family relation is a wear of the fund in our
bank.

I want you to come and stand as the late deceased Next of Kin and
business partner to claim his balance with our bank no matter the
country you came from bank will release and transfer the fund into
your account and be rest assured to have my support during the claim
for I am the late deceased account manager before he met his sudden
death in the plane crash with his family on their way traveling for
Summer Holidays.

I am contacting you to come and claim the fund through my support
because the bank laws here does not allow any inheritance fund to stay
more than 16years in the bank coffers without claiming by the
concerned family for the money will be recalled to the bank Treasury
account as unclaimed funds.

I am ready to share with you 50% for you and 50% for me and by
indicating your interest and capability to execute the project with me
after reading message; I will send you more details on how the fund
will be officially transfer in your account for the transaction will
be execute in your favor without any problem for the only thing i want
from you is to be honest with me during the transaction official
process.

I will be waiting for your urgent response to enable me feed you with
more details for us to proceed ahead.

Thanks.

Best Regards,


Mr. Mohammad Ahmed
