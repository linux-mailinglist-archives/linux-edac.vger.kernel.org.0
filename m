The purpose of this patch is to address the lack of tracepoints for PCIe
hotplug events in our production environment. In the initial RFC
version, I defined tracepoints such as "Link Up" and "Link Down"
specifically for PCIe hotplug. Later, Lukas suggested that these
tracepoints could be made more generic so that other PCI hotplug drivers
could also use them.

That’s why, when defining the event, I used a "generic" pci_hotplug_event
instead of a pcie_hotplug_event. If you're interested in more details
about this discussion, please refer to this link[1].

[1]https://erol.kernel.org/linux-pci/git/0/commit/?id=0ffd56f572f25bcd6c2265a1863848a18dce0e29

However, currently only PCIe hotplug is using these tracepoints, which
is why the CREATE_TRACE_POINTS macro is placed in
drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp_ctrl.c.

Yes.

Actually, the tracepoints are generic, although right now they are only
used for PCIe hotplug.

I think this is also common. For example, MF_PAGE_TYPE for
memory_failure_event uses a similar format:

#define MF_PAGE_TYPE \
	EM ( MF_MSG_KERNEL, "reserved kernel page" ) \
	EM ( MF_MSG_KERNEL_HIGH_ORDER, "high-order kernel page" )


and aer_uncorrectable_errors for aer_event:

#define aer_uncorrectable_errors				\
	{PCI_ERR_UNC_UND,	"Undefined"},			\
	{PCI_ERR_UNC_DLP,	"Data Link Protocol Error"},	\
	{PCI_ERR_UNC_SURPDN,	"Surprise Down Error"},		\
	{PCI_ERR_UNC_POISON_TLP,"Poisoned TLP"},

Aha, this is a bit tricky:)

The original kernel log messages are not consistent either:

ctrl_info(ctrl, "Slot(%s): Link Down\n",
ctrl_info(ctrl, "Slot(%s): Card not present\n",

I tried to keep the output as close as possible to the existing log
messages. If you prefer a more consistent capitalization style, I can
send another patch to fix that.

Thank you again for applying this to pci/trace for v6.17. If there’s
anything more to tweak in the commit log or event text, please let me
know.

Best regards,
