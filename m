I am sorry, this is typo. I mean asynchronous interrupt.

Thank you. Will fix it.

Will fix it.

Nope. The memory_failure() runs in a kthread context, but not the
user-space process which consuming poison data.


    // kill_proc() in memory-failure.c

	if ((flags & MF_ACTION_REQUIRED) && (t == current))
		ret = force_sig_mceerr(BUS_MCEERR_AR,
				 (void __user *)tk->addr, addr_lsb);
	else
		ret = send_sig_mceerr(BUS_MCEERR_AO, (void __user *)tk->addr,
				      addr_lsb, t);

So, even we queue memory_failure() with MF_ACTION_REQUIRED flags in
previous patch, it will still send a sigbus with BUS_MCEERR_AO in the else
branch of kill_proc().

The signal issue is not fixed completely. See my reply above.

If no memory failure work is queued for abnormal errors, do a force kill.
Will also add this comment to commit log.

I handle memory_failure() error code in its arm64 call site
memory_failure_cb() with some comments, similar to x86 call site
kill_me_maybe(). I moved these two part comments to function declaration,
followed by review comments from Kefeng.

I should split this into a separate patch. Will do it in next version.

Are you suggesting to move fields of struct sync_task_work to struct
ghes_estatus_node, and use ghes_estatus_node here? Or we can just alloc
struct sync_task_work with gen_pool_alloc from ghes_estatus_pool.

For example:
- invalid GUID section in ghes_do_proc()
- CPER_MEM_VALID_PA is not set, unexpected severity in
  ghes_handle_memory_failure().
- CONFIG_ACPI_APEI_MEMORY_FAILURE is not enabled, !pfn_vaild(pfn) in
  ghes_do_memory_failure()

Sorry, I don't think so. Unconditionally send a sigbus is not a good
choice.  For example, if a sync memory error detected in instruction memory
error, the kernel should transparently fix and no signal should be send.

    ./einj_mem_uc instr
    [168522.751671] Memory failure: 0x89dedd: corrupted page was clean: dropped without side effects
    [168522.751679] Memory failure: 0x89dedd: recovery action for clean LRU page: Recovered

With this patch set, the instr case behaves consistently on both the arm64 and x86 platforms.

The complex page error_states are handled in memory_failure(). IMHO, we
should left this part to it.

As mentioned, I will split this into a separate patch.
