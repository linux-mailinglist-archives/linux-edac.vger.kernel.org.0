As Ard clarified, I was questioning the inclusion of the Reported-by:
tag in the patch itself. But I also don't have enough of a strong
opinion to obsess about it.

[ Aside: One interesting consequence of this though is that by the same
argument, changes resulting from comments on earlier versions are also
legitimate content for the final patch. Not saying I agree. ]

Oops. My bad - sorry I missed the response.

Copying the relevant comment here for discussion -

>>> The registers here are implementation specific and applies only for
>>> SMCA systems. So I have used pointer arithmetic as it is not defined
>>> in the spec.

Even though it's not defined in the UEFI spec, it doesn't mean a
structure definition cannot be created. After all, the patch is relying
on some guarantee of the meaning of the values and their ordering.

If the patch is relying on the definitions in the SMCA spec it is a good
idea to reference it here - both for review and providing relevant
context for future developers.

> You might've missed it because you weren't CCed directly.

Indeed, I missed it. Thanks for the pointer.

Cheers,
Punit
