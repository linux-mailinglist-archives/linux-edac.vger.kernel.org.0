Hi All,

I'm looking for some reviews on this series if anyone has time to take
a look.  Rasdaemon patches to match with this are on linux-edac but
are waiting on the tracepoints merging.

I'm not currently planning to upstream the qemu injection patches
used to test this but anyone would like those I can certainly put
a public branch up somewhere.

Thanks,

Jonathan
