Hi Shuai,

I'm struggling with 'synchronous interrupt'. Do you mean arm64's 'precise' (all
instructions before the exception were executed, and none after).
Otherwise, surely any interrupt from a background scrubber is inherently asynchronous!

It does it regardless, if user-space was interrupted by APEI any work queued as a result
of that should be completed before we go back to user-space. Otherwise we can bounce
between user-space and firmware, with the kernel only running the APEI code, and never
making progress.

This is hard to parse, "the user-space process is accessing"? (dropping 'actual' and
adding 'is')


Wasn't this behaviour fixed by the previous patch?

What problem are you fixing here?

Why? The signal issue was fixed by the previous patch. Why delay the handling of a
poisoned memory location further?

... do what?

I'm not sure how this hunk is relevant to the commit message.

Yuck - New failure modes! This is why the existing code always has this memory allocated
in struct ghes_estatus_node.

I think this is a lot of churn, and this hunk is the the only meaningful change in
behaviour. Can you explain how this happens?


Wouldn't it be simpler to split ghes_kick_task_work() to have a sync/async version.
The synchronous version can unconditionally force_sig_mceerr(BUS_MCEERR_AR, ...) after
memory_failure_queue_kick() - but that still means memory_failure() is unable to disappear
errors that it fixed - see MF_RECOVERED.
