Thanks for the SMCA related background.

I think I understand the hesitancy here if the firmware can arbitrarily
move the starting address. Though I hope that doesn't happen as it would
break the feature introduced in $SUBJECT.

The way I read the code / spec led me to believe that the MSR context
info records in the SMCA space are just encoding the layout of MC Bank
registers[0] and making it explicit can only help.

But Boris seems to think the current approach is good enough. So no
objections from me.
