That makes sense for Qemu, but I don't think it's appropriate for this
type of reporting.  E.g. if EPT and Unrestricted Guest are must-be-one on
a hypothetical (virtual) CPU, it'd be odd to not list them as a supported
feature.

For actual hardware (well, Intel hardware), as proposed it's a moot point.
The only features that are must-be-one (even without "true" MSRs) and are
documented in the SDM are CR3_LOAD_EXITING, CR3_STORE_EXITING,
SAVE_DEBUG_CONTROLS, and LOAD_DEBUG_CONTROLS, none of which are reported
in /proc/cpuinfo.

> Also, shouldn't this use the "true" feature availability MSRs if available?

Only if incorporating the "& ~msr_low" can-be-one logic.  If a feature is
considered supported if it must-be-one or can-be-one then the true MSR and
vanilla MSR will yield the same feature set.
