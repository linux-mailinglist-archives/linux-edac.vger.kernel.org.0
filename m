Agreed.

According to the CPU folks FRED systems are guaranteed to have WRMSRNS -
I asked for that :). It's just not yet documented.

But that I aside, I agree that we should opt for the safe side with a
fallback like the one you have in XEN even for the places which are
strictly FRED dependent.

Correct.

I fundamentaly hate adding this to the PV infrastructure. We don't want
more PV ops, quite the contrary.

For the initial use case at hand, there is an explicit FRED dependency
and the code in question really wants to use WRMSRNS directly and not
through a PV function call.

I agree with your reasoning for the more generic use case where we can
gain performance independent of FRED by using WRMSRNS for cases where
the write has no serialization requirements.

But this made me look into PV ops some more. For actual performance
relevant code the current PV ops mechanics are a horrorshow when the op
defaults to the native instruction.

Let's look at wrmsrl():

wrmsrl(msr, val
 wrmsr(msr, (u32)val, (u32)val >> 32))
  paravirt_write_msr(msr, low, high)
    PVOP_VCALL3(cpu.write_msr, msr, low, high)

Which results in

	mov	$msr, %edi
	mov	$val, %rdx
	mov	%edx, %esi
	shr	$0x20, %rdx
	call	native_write_msr

and native_write_msr() does at minimum:

	mov    %edi,%ecx
	mov    %esi,%eax
	wrmsr
        ret

In the worst case 'ret' is going through the return thunk. Not to talk
about function prologues and whatever.

This becomes even more silly for trivial instructions like STI/CLI or in
the worst case paravirt_nop().

The call makes only sense, when the native default is an actual
function, but for the trivial cases it's a blatant engineering
trainwreck.

I wouldn't care at all if CONFIG_PARAVIRT_XXL would be the esoteric use
case, but AFAICT it's default enabled on all major distros.

So no. I'm fundamentally disagreeing with your recommendation. The way
forward is:

  1) Provide the native variant for wrmsrns(), i.e. rename the proposed
     wrmsrns() to native_wrmsr_ns() and have the X86_FEATURE_WRMSRNS
     safety net as you pointed out.

     That function can be used in code which is guaranteed to be not
     affected by the PV_XXL madness.

  2) Come up with a sensible solution for the PV_XXL horrorshow

  3) Implement a sane general variant of wrmsr_ns() which handles
     both X86_FEATURE_WRMSRNS and X86_MISFEATURE_PV_XXL

  4) Convert other code which benefits from the non-serializing variant
     to wrmsr_ns()

        tglx
