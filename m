It would be good if you could mention in the commit message that
you intend to use rasdaemon for monitoring these tracepoints
and that you're hence adding the enum to a uapi header.
So that if someone wonders later on why you chose a uapi header,
they will find breadcrumbs in the commit message.

I think both patches can be squashed into one.

I'm not an expert on tracepoints, so when respinning, perhaps you
could cc linux-trace-kernel@vger.kernel.org and maybe also tracing
maintainers so that subject matter experts can look the patch over
and ack it.

Maybe "pci_hotplug" to differentiate this from, say, cpu hotplug?

PCI_HOTPLUG_CARD_NOT_PRESENT would be neater I think.

Not sure what "trans state" stands for, maybe "state transition"?
What if we add tracepoints going forward which aren't for state
transitions but other types of events, such as "Power Failure"?
Perhaps something more generic such as "PCI_HOTPLUG_EVENT" would
be more apt?

I note that this is called "pci_hotplug_trans_type", perhaps for
consistency use "pci_hotplug_trans_state" as everywhere else
(or whatever you choose to substitute the name for, see above).

Other than these cosmetic things, the patches LGTM.
Again, my knowledge on tracepoints is superficial, but broadly
it looks reasonable.

Thanks,

Lukas
