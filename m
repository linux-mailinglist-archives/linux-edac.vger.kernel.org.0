Steven or other tracing people, can you check below the 
discussion/question on preferred placement of the tracing 
related code.

The biggest remaining uncertainty related to the placement of some of the 
tracepoint code (tracepoint creation and the trace header). None of us 
knew the answer so we tried to ask a more informed opinion from others but 
that never resulted us getting any answer.

I've a patch which adds tracing to bwctrl [1] (I'll send it officially 
once the placement discussion concludes), and in it, I ended up adding 
drivers/pci/pci-trace.c as the place where to define the tracepoints and 
include/trace/events/pci.h as the trace header placement, whereas this 
patch added them both into the hp driver code.

So if you (Bjorn) are fine placing them into each individual driver as 
done in this patch and tracing folks don't provide us guidance, we can 
go with that approach.

The placement discussion is in this subleaf of the thread:
