rasdaemon already collects errors and even saves them in a database of
sorts. No kernel changes needed.

Not necessarily - see above.

Huh, are you talking about providing customers with error information
from the *underlying* physical machine which runs the cloud VMs? That
sounds suspicious, to say the least.

AFAICT, all you can tell the VM owner is: yah, the hw had an
uncorrectable error in its memory and crashed. Is that the use case?

To be able to tell the VM owners why it crashed?

I think you're confusing things: MCEs do get reported to userspace
through the trace_mc_record tracepoint and rasdaemon opens it and reads
error info from there. And then writes it out to its db. So that works
now.

GHES is something different: it is a fw glue around error reporting so
that you don't have to develop a reporting driver for every platform but
you can use a single one - only the fw glue needs to be added.

The problem with GHES is that it is notoriously buggy and currently
it loads on a single platform only on x86.

ARM are doing something in that area - you're better off talking to
James Morse about it. And he's on Cc.

Now that is yet another thing: you want to save error records into
firmware. First of all, you don't really need it if you do kdump as
explained above.

Then, that thing has its own troubles: it is buggy like every firmware
is and it can brick the machine.

I'm not saying it is not useful - there are some use cases for it which
are being worked on but if all you wanna do is dump MCEs to rasdaemon,
that works even now.

But then you have an ARM patch there and I'm confused because MCEs are
x86 thing - ARM has different stuff.

So I think you need to elaborate more here.

Thx.
