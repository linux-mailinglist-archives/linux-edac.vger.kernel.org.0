Hi James,

Thanks for your clarification. This sort of non-provocative 
clarifications of the regulations you need to comply to has always been 
what the community wants to see. _This_ should have been the first 
official statement when anyone raised the concern, instead of Greg's 
attempt to "defuse" the situation over private correspondence, or Linus 
Torvald's outright defamation and accusing anyone who dares to disagree 
of being a "Russian troll". This is not even to mention the _complete 
ignorance_ and arrogance shown by his statement on what sending a revert 
patch means.

With sanctions in place, there is no reasonable person who will demand 
the LF or the Linux Kernel maintainers to do otherwise. However, as 
someone who does rely on Linux for daily work, and as someone who has 
contributed to the Linux project and its community, I think seeing the 
following should be the minimum:

1. Linus Torvalds (+Cc) send an apology letter to **everyone** who he 
accused of being a Russian troll;
2. Linus Torvalds need to **unconditionally retract** his personal 
attack on Kexy Biscuit, the person who sent the revert patch in protest 
(+Cc), and acknowledge that people who work with AOSC.io aren't 
"state-sponsored paid actors";
3. This type of statement should be included somewhere public as soon as 
practically possible should sanction compliance affect kernel 
development again in the future;
4. No personal attacks should be allowed based on tinfoil-hat reasoning.

Thanks,
Peter.
