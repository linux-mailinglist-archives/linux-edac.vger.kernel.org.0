Hi, Borislav,

Thank you for your comments.

But we are talking about Action Required error, it does happen *inside the
current execution context*.  The Action Required error does not meet the
function comments.

When a Action Required error occurs, it triggers a MCE-like exception
(SEA).  In the first call of memory_failure(), it will poison the page. If
it failed to unmap the error page, the user space task resumes at the
current PC and triggers another SEA exception, then the second call of
memory_failure() will run into kill_accessing_process() which do nothing
and just return -EFAULT. As a result, a third SEA exception will be
triggered.  Finally, a exception loop happens resulting a hard lockup
panic.

In ARM64 platform, when a Action Required error occurs, the kernel should
send SIGBUS with si_code BUS_MCEERR_AR instead of BUS_MCEERR_AO. (It is
also the subject of this thread)

> stared at code?

I met the wrong si_code problem on Yitian 710 machine which is based on
ARM64 platform. And I think it is gernel on ARM64 platfrom.

To reproduce this problem:

	# STEP1: enable early kill mode
	#sysctl -w vm.memory_failure_early_kill=1
	vm.memory_failure_early_kill = 1

	# STEP2: inject an UCE error and consume it to trigger a synchronous error
	#einj_mem_uc single
	0: single   vaddr = 0xffffb0d75400 paddr = 4092d55b400
	injecting ...
	triggering ...
	signal 7 code 5 addr 0xffffb0d75000
	page not present
	Test passed

The si_code (code 5) from einj_mem_uc indicates that it is BUS_MCEERR_AO error
and it is not fact.

After this patch set:

	# STEP1: enable early kill mode
	#sysctl -w vm.memory_failure_early_kill=1
	vm.memory_failure_early_kill = 1

	# STEP2: inject an UCE error and consume it to trigger a synchronous error
	#einj_mem_uc single
	0: single   vaddr = 0xffffb0d75400 paddr = 4092d55b400
	injecting ...
	triggering ...
	signal 7 code 4 addr 0xffffb0d75000
	page not present
	Test passed

The si_code (code 4) from einj_mem_uc indicates that it is BUS_MCEERR_AR error
as we expected.

We both got wrong si_code of SIGBUS from kernel side on ARM64 platform.

The VMM in our product relies on the si_code of SIGBUS to handle memory
failure in userspace.

- For BUS_MCEERR_AO, we regard that the corruptions happen *outside the
  current execution context* e.g. detected by a background scrubber, the
  VMM will ignore the error and the VM will not be killed immediately.
- For BUS_MCEERR_AR, we regard that the corruptions happen *insdie the
  current execution context*, e.g. when a data poison is consumed, the VMM
  will kill the VM immediately to avoid any further potential data
  propagation.

Sorry, Borislav, thank you for your patient and time. I really appreciate
that you are involving in to review this patchset. But I have to say it is
not the truth, I am avoiding anything. I tried my best to answer every comments
you raised, give the details of ARM RAS specific and code flow.

Shuai
