Please don't think of errors as "action required" - that's a user-space signal code. If
the page could be fixed by memory-failure(), you may never get a signal. (all this was the
fix for always sending an action-required signal)

I assume you mean the CPU accessed a poisoned location and took a synchronous error.

Yes, this is what is expected to happen with the existing code.

The first pass will remove the pages from all processes that have it mapped before this
user-space task can restart. Restarting the task will make it access a poisoned page,
kicking off the second path which delivers the signal.

The reason for two passes is send_sig_mceerr() likes to clear_siginfo(), so even if you
queued action-required before leaving GHES, memory-failure() would stomp on it.


> I still don't know what you're fixing here.

The problem is if the user-space process registered for early messages, it gets a signal
on the first pass. If it returns from that signal, it will access the poisoned page and
get the action-required signal.

How is this making Qemu go wrong?


As to how this works for you given Boris' comments above: kill_procs() is also called from
hwpoison_user_mappings(), which takes the flags given to memory-failure(). This is where
the action-optional signals come from.


Thanks,

James
