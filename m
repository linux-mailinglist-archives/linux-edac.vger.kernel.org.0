Hi, Borislav,

Thank you very much for your valuable comments.

Got it, thank you. Will fix in next version.

The comments from Robert in v1[1] ask me to explicitly list those differences,

	It is not really duplicate yet, changes are slightly different which
	could trigger problems in some parsers. At least those differences
	should be listed in the patch description.

Should I keep it here? Or delete it and just add why.

Got it, thank you very much. But as you mentioned bellow, the purpose of this
patch is to unify memory error report format with cper so that we can use use
cper_mem_err_location() directly. Actually, this patch series is originally
suggested by Tony[2] to share the same code with cper. Should I split this
patch by function?

Yep, these fields are unpopulated by BIOS, I manually enable all Validation
Bits for debug so that we see the difference more clearly. I will declare it
in next version.

Well, the purpose is not to improve but unify.

To unify memory error report format with cper. Should we use cper
or ghes_edac version?

Sorry for this bug. Will fix in next version.

Well, Robert suggested me add a unification patch[1] so that we could review
the changes more clearly. I think it makes sense.

	It is not really duplicate yet, changes are slightly different which
	could trigger problems in some parsers. At least those differences
	should be listed in the patch description. I would rather remove the
	'space' delimiter after the colon and take the ghes version of it as
	logs become harder to read. So ideally there is a unification patch
	before the "duplication" is removed with changes in both files as
	necessary for review and to document the change.
