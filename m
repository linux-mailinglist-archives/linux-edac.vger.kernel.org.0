We can do analysis of whether the interfaces are suitable etc but
have no access to test hardware or emulation. I guess I can hack something
together easily enough. Today ndctl has some support. Interestingly the mod=
el
is different from typical volatile scrubbing as it's all on demand - that
could be easily wrapped up in a software scrub scheduler though, but we'd n=
eed
input from you and other Intel people on how this is actually used.=20

The use model is a lot less obvious than autonomous scrubbers - I assume be=
cause
the persistence means you need to do this rarely if at all (though ARS does
support scrubbing volatile memory on nvdimms)

So initial conclusion is it would need a few more controls or it needs
some software handling of scan scheduling to map it to the interface type
that is common to CXL and RAS2 scrub controls.

Intent of the comment was to keep scope somewhat confined, and to=20
invite others to get involved, not to rule out doing some light weight
analysis of whether this feature would work for another potential user
which we weren't even aware of until you mentioned it (thanks!).

=46rom discussions with various firmware folk we have a chicken and egg
situation on RAS2. They will stick to their custom solutions unless there is
plausible support in Linux for it - so right now it's a question mark
on roadmaps. Trying to get rid of that question mark is why Shiju and I
started looking at this in the first place. To get rid of that question
mark we don't necessarily need to have it upstream, but we do need
to be able to make the argument that there will be a solution ready
soon after they release the BIOS image.  (Some distros will take years
to catch up though).

If anyone else an speak up on this point please do. Discussions and
feedback communicated to Shiju and I off list aren't going to
convince people :(
Negatives perhaps easier to give than positives given this is seen as
a potential feature for future platforms so may be confidential.

Obviously can't talk about who was involved in this feature
in it's definition, but I have strong confidence it will get implemented
for reasons I can point at on a public list.=20
a) There will be scrubbing on devices.
b) It will need control (evidence for this is the BIOS controls mentioned b=
elow
   for equivalent main memory).
c) Hotplug means that control must be done by OS driver (or via very fiddly
   pre hotplug hacks that I think we can all agree should not be necessary
   and aren't even an option on all platforms)
d) No one likes custom solutions.
This isn't a fancy feature with a high level of complexity which helps.

Today there is the option for main memory of leaving it to BIOS parameters.
A quick google gave me some examples (to make sure they are public):
Dell: PowerEdge R640 BIOS and UEFI Reference Guide
  - Memory patrol scrub - Sets the memory patrol scrub frequency.
HP UEFI System Utilities for HPE ProLiant Gen 11 SErvers
  - Enabling or disable patrol scrub
Spec list of flags for lenovo systems (tells you that turning patrol scrub
   off is a good idea ;)
Huawei Kunpeng 920 RAS config menu.=20
  - Active Scrub, Active Scrub interval etc.

Sure, more of an essay needed along with links given we are talking
about the views of others.

Quick summary from a reread of the linked threads.
AMD not implemented RASF/RAS2 yet - looking at it last year, but worried
about inflexibility of RAS2 spec today. They were looking at some spec
changes to improve this + other functions to be added to RAS2.
I agree with it being limited, but think extending with backwards
compatibility isn't a problem (and ACPI spec rules in theory guarantee
it won't break).  I'm keen on working with current version
so that we can ensure the ABI design for CXL encompasses it.

Intel folk were cc'd but not said anything on that thread, but Tony Luck
did comment in Jiaqi Yan's software scrubbing discussion linked below.
He observed that a hardware implementation can be complex if doing range
based scrubbing due to interleave etc. RAS2 and CXL both side step this
somewhat by making it someone elses problem. In RAS2 the firmware gets
to program multiple scrubbers to cover the range requested. In CXL
for now this leaves the problem for userspace, but we can definitely
consider a region interface if it makes sense.

I'd also like to see inputs from a wider range of systems folk + other
CPU companies.  How easy this is to implement is heavily dependent on
what entity in your system is responsible for this sort of runtime
service and that varies a lot.

It's not a changelog as such but a RFC in text only form.
However indeed lots of good info in there.
