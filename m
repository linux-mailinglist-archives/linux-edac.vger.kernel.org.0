The code is licensed under GPLV2, so what precludes any other GPLV2 project
to import that code?

If there is a mentioning of CCIX Consortium in the imported code then you
cannot impose that this needs to be removed because it ends up in something
which is neither Linux kernel nor associated user space. And that's
especially true when this ends up being a copyright notice.
