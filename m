Yes, I mean that CPU accessed a poisoned location and took a synchronous error.

The problem here is that we need to assume, the first pass memory failure
handle and unmap the poisoned page successfully.

- If so, it may work by the second pass action-requried signal because it
  access an unmapped page. But IMHO, we can improve by just sending one
  pass signal, so that the Guest will vmexit only once, right?

- If not, there is no second pass signal. The exist code does not handle
  the error code from memory_failure(), so a exception loop happens
  resulting a hard lockup panic.

Besides, in production environment, a second access to an already known
poison page will introduce more risk of error propagation.

Thank you very much for involving to review and comment.
