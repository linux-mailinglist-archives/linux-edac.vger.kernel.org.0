AFAIU, I think you want something like the below untested hunk:

You set it to 0 when it cannot find an element and that "ret = 1" we can
remove because callers don't care about the offlining threshold - the
only caller that looks at its retval wants to know whether it added the
VA successfully to note that it handled the error.

Makes sense?
