That is supposed to be explained in [] properly so that there's no
misreading of why that tag's there.

It should jump on patches which have Fixes: tags. But Sasha's bot is
nuts regardless. :-)

So I don't mind having a Reported-by: tag with an explanation of what
it reported. We slap all kinds of tags so having some attribution for
the work the 0day bot does to catch such errors is reasonable. I presume
they track this way how "useful" it is, by counting the Reported-by's or
so, as they suggest one should add a Reported-by in their reports.

And without any attribution what the 0day bot reported, it might decide
not to report anything next time, I'd venture a guess.

And the same argument can be had for Suggested-by: tags: one could
decide not to add that tag and the person who's doing the suggesting
might decide not to suggest anymore.

So I think something like:

 [ Fix a build breakage in an earlier version. ]
Reported-by: 0day bot

is fine as long as it makes it perfectly clear what Reported-by tag
is for and as long as ts purpose for being present there is clear, I
don't see an issue...
