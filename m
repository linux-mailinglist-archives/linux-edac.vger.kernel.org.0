Hi Serge,

I'm really angry that it has come to this.
Fuck the fascists for bullying the Russians from the community.
I'm just a regular end user who has been using Linux for 17 years.
I was born in 1991, the same year the kernel was created.
This is so fucking disgusting.

Lots of love, in solidarity,

Khalil from Toronto, Canada
