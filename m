Yes, thanks.

However, you don't have to resend immediately but wait instead until
people have had time to review the whole thing. And while you're
waiting, you can read through Documentation/process/...

There are passages like the following one, for example:

"Don't get discouraged - or impatient
------------------------------------

After you have submitted your change, be patient and wait.  Reviewers are
busy people and may not get to your patch right away.

Once upon a time, patches used to disappear into the void without comment,
but the development process works more smoothly than that now.  You should
receive comments within a week or so; if that does not happen, make sure
that you have sent your patches to the right place.  Wait for a minimum of
one week before resubmitting or pinging reviewers - possibly longer during
busy times like merge windows.

It's also ok to resend the patch or the patch series after a couple of
weeks with the word "RESEND" added to the subject line::

   [PATCH Vx RESEND] sub/sys: Condensed patch summary

Don't add "RESEND" when you are submitting a modified version of your
patch or patch series - "RESEND" only applies to resubmission of a
patch or patch series which have not been modified in any way from the
previous submission."
