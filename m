Maybe I could've used a better choice of words - I meant to define a
structure with meaningful member names to replace the *(ptr + i)
accesses in the patch.

The requirement for documenting the record layout doesn't change -
whether using raw pointer arithmetic vs a structure definition.

If there's no spec backing the current layout, then it'll indeed be an
ad-hoc definition of a structure in the kernel. But considering that
it's part of firmware / OS interface for an important part of the RAS
story I would hope that the code is based on a spec - having that
reference included would help maintainability.

Incompatible changes will indeed break the assumptions in the kernel and
code will need to be updated - regardless of the choice of kernel
implementation; pointer arithmetic, structure definition - ad-hoc or
spec provided.

Having versioning will allow running older kernels on newer hardware and
vice versa - but I don't see why that is important only when using a
structure based access.
